## 🚀 Projects

### 🎙️ Voice Assistant (Terminal-Based)
A smart assistant built using `speech_recognition`, `pyttsx3`, and `webbrowser`.  
It listens to your commands, speaks back, and can perform actions like opening websites and answering questions.

**Features:**
- Voice recognition and response
- Web search & control
- Expandable `answer()` backend function

> ✅ Best for CLI lovers who want voice-powered automation.

### 🚀 Space Shooter Game (Pygame)
An arcade-style space shooter game made using **Pygame**.  
Dodge enemies, shoot bullets, collect reloads, and survive!

**Features:**
- Player movement and shooting
- Enemy and reload generation
- Score count
- Collision logic
- Gameover screen

> 🎮 A fun way to learn game dev basics with object-oriented code.

### 🧍 Face Detection (OpenCV)
A face detection project using **OpenCV** where you can place an image in the `images/` folder, update the filename in the code, and run `main.py`. It detects faces with rectangles and saves the result in the `detected/` folder.

**Features:**
- Face detection using Open CV
- Easy to use: just replace image and run
- Automatically saves output with rectangles drawn

> 📸 Simple and powerful introduction to computer vision.
